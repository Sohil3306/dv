      "Enter the text corpus:  One day, a young man walked into a small town where people lived simple lives, and he felt the world around him was full of time, work, and change. He saw children play in the street, women talk near the shop, and men build new houses with old tools. Life seemed good, though hard, and every person had a story about love, family, and home. The man thought about his own way, his hand holding a book, his eyes on the road, and his heart open to friends. He wanted to make things better, to give help, to find truth, and to keep hope alive. In that place, he learned that great power was not in money or big names but in small acts, kind words, and strong faith. By the end of the week, he knew that the right path was not far; it was here, now, with people, with work, with love, with life.\n"
